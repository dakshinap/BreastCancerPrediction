# Breast Cancer Prediction
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to predict whether a Breast Cancer Tumor is Malignant or Benign.

## How it works
  - Read in the dataset using `pandas` read_csv function
  - Preprocess the dataset
  - Split the dataset into training , validation and testing samples
  - Train the models 
  - Test the models
  - Perform evaluation on the results
  - Select the model that generates the best results

### Compilation and Execution

To execute this program on your machine, you need to have the following installed on your machine.
`python`,`pandas`,`scikit-learn`,`numpy`
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pandas 
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
```

To run the code,

```sh
$ python classifiers.py
```
Once this successfsully runs, resulting images will be stored in the `image/` directory that contains evaluation results for the different models used here
